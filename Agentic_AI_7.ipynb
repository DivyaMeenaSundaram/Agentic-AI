The finish is long and lingering, leaving a pleasant warmth. This coffee is perfect for those who crave a strong, assertive cup in the morning, or as a pick-me-up throughout the day. It’s a truly invigorating experience. For espresso lovers, the crema produced is rich and velvety, adding to the overall indulgence. The packaging is also well-designed, keeping the powder fresh.
