            "    *   **Lack of agency:**  It doesn't initiate actions or make decisions independently. It's reactive, responding only to user input.\n",
            "    *   **Limited memory:**  Its context window (the amount of information it can remember) is finite, leading to potential loss of information in long conversations.\n",
